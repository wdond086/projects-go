# Projects Go

A collection of projects I have built in Golang out of curiousity or learning.

## Setup

1. Install the recommended extensions:

    - Run `View -> Extensions -> Show Recommended Extensions`

2. Open `projects-go.code-workspace`
3. Press **Ctrl + Shift + B** to build or run tests

## Projects

- [Task Manager CLI app](./task_manager_cli/)
